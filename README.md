# G_ProE
This repository contains the very begining developing process of this Project.
This stop is deprecated due to I change the master to the prveious head with command "$ git checkout -B master", this may made some damage in the .git file, therefore I can't push the project to heroku.
I have to delete the .git file of this Proejct "G_ProE" locally, and init git for the project and push it as a new repository both in github and Heroku.
